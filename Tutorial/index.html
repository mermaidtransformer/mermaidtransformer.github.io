          <h1>If you made it that far and informed yourself enough,<br>
     is here a tutorial for the transformation</h1> 
          <p>To become a mermaid or a merman, you have to get completely wet by pouring water<br>
          over yourself or bathing in chlorine-free  water during the full moon.<br>
          Then, you have to hold your hands up towards the full moon for 10 to 20 minutes.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Here are a few more tips so it might work better: </h2>
      <ul>
         <li> Use natural water, such as water from a lake or stream or, of course, the ocean. </li>
         <li> Wear a piece of jewelry, such as a necklace, during the ritual. </li>
         <li> Some sources also claim that you should hold your hands "V-shaped" to the full moon. </li>
         <li>It is also said to help if you swim or dive for half an hour afterwards<br>
               or think very hard about mermaids. Of course, this works best <br>
               if you try it together with a friend and then talk about it. </li>
         <li>Besides, most transformations have happened in the sea, <br>
               but you almost never hear about "pool mermaids". :) </li>
     </ul>
      <h4>Very famous for transforming is Mako Island located in Australia </h4>
